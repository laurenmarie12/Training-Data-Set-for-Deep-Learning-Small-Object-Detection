# Training-Data-Set-for-Deep-Learning-Small-Object-Detection

This capstone project focuses on the creation of a comprehensive training dataset specifically designed for deep learning-based small object detection. 
The project aims to address the challenges associated with detecting and accurately localizing small objects in images, which often require specialized 
techniques due to their size,complexity, or limited visual features.

The files listed are the various scripts I wrote to do this project. The final versions are segment.py and viewer.py.  rewrite
